DESCRIPTION:
In this first small project, the task was to re-create Google's homepage with the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS learned.

What I learned:

1) Operating in a workflow from start to bottom is extremely beneficiary. For HTML re-creating the physical buttons/text/images on screen would always be a good start.

2) Similarly CSS is best working top to bottom, however it is still challenging to get the layout riight. Will require more trial-and-error  and learning on the go.

3) It doesn't need to be perfect. Create, improve and stay motivated!
